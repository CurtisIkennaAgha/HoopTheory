Led by Coach Bao, a skilled basketball coach with a background in physiotherapy, Hoop Theory offers a scientific, evidence-based approach to training. The coaching philosophy revolves around personalized, progressive, and adaptable plans tailored to meet the unique goals of each athlete.

  Private and Semi-Private Sessions for Targeted Training
  
  Hoop Theory provides both private and semi-private sessions that cater to individual and small group needs. The one-on-one coaching sessions allow for direct communication with Coach Bao, offering 24/7 support, an initial consultation to discuss training goals, and monthly check-ins to review progress. These sessions are designed to provide the personalized attention and structure needed to maximize improvement.
  
  For those looking for a more social learning experience, Hoop Theory also offers semi-private group sessions, where players can work with up to six others in a collaborative environment. These sessions include adaptable drills suitable for players at different levels, from beginners to elite athletes, and come with discounted pricing for members of Portsmouth Force and the University of Portsmouth (BUCS).
  
  Exclusive Online Coaching and Drill Database
  
  In addition to in-person training, Hoop Theory offers an exclusive online coaching program that grants athletes access to a members-only area for continuous support.
